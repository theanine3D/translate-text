## Installation
1. Click the green "Code" button above and press "Download ZIP"

3. Click the "Install..." button and browse to the ZIP file you just downloaded, select it, and press "Install Add-on"

## Tips
- After installing the addon, you must then install the addon's dependencies. There's an "Install Dependencies" button underneath the addon listing in Blender's preferences. Please be patient after pressing the button. Dependencies are conveniently installed into the addon's own folder, so deleting the addon's folder will remove all of the dependencies as well. 
- The translate settings panel can be found in the right sidebar of the Text Editor in Blender. Press Ctrl + T to open the sidebar and then click on the "Translate" tab.
- Translations are stored in a text file named after the target language. For example, if you translate English to Chinese, a text file named "Chinese" will be used to store the resulting translation. If a text file with that name doesn't exist, the addon will create one.
