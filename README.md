# Translate Text
Blender (3.0+) addon that adds translation features to Blender's text editor. Tutorial makers and 3D educators that teach multilanguage classes may find this addon useful for showing step-by-step instructions in multiple languages.

## Features
- Translating text via 4 different translation services
  - Google
  - Bing
  - Baidu
  - Sogou
- Translating between 13 different languages:
  - English
  - Chinese
  - Spanish
  - Arabic
  - German
  - Portuguese
  - Russian
  - French
  - Japanese
  - Korean
  - Vietnamese
  - Punjabi
  - Hindi
- Reverse translate - instantly reverse the language settings
- Fast Language Toggle - allows instantly switching Blender's whole UI between two different languages, using a single button press or custom hotkey

## Installation
1. Click the green "Code" button above and press "Download ZIP"
2. Go into Blender's addon preferences (File → Preferences → Addons)
3. Click the "Install..." button and browse to the ZIP file you just downloaded, select it, and press "Install Add-on"

## Tips
- After installing the addon, you must then install the addon's dependencies. There's an "Install Dependencies" button underneath the addon listing in Blender's preferences. Please be patient after pressing the button. Dependencies are conveniently installed into the addon's own folder, so deleting the addon's folder will remove all of the dependencies as well. 
- The translate settings panel can be found in the right sidebar of the Text Editor in Blender. Press Ctrl + T to open the sidebar and then click on the "Translate" tab.
- Translations are stored in a text file named after the target language. For example, if you translate English to Chinese, a text file named "Chinese" will be used to store the resulting translation. If a text file with that name doesn't exist, the addon will create one. 
- This addon is best used by keeping two separate text editors open in Blender, one for the source language, and one for the target language. See preview below for an example.
